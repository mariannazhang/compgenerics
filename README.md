# Computational generics
This repository contains information for the project computational generics. It builds off of [a previous version of this project](https://github.com/markkho/generics-learning/).

If you have any questions, please contact me (Marianna Zhang) at <marianna.zhang@nyu.edu>.

## Data
Contains data (in .csv) from the empirical study. 

## Models
Contains code (in Python) to run the model and produce figures of predictions.

### App
Contains a streamlit app to play with different model parameters and generate predictions. To run the app:
1. Fork this repo.
2. Install [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation) and required packages, such as [gorgo](https://github.com/markkho/gorgo).
3. Run the app locally:
```
streamlit run models/app/app.py
```
